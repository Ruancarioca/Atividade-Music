I remember
The hardest are the times I don't forget
Neverender
And all I was about to be
'Cause I remember
The hardest are the times I don't forget
Like an ember
Burning on
Because I remember
The hardest are the times I don't forget
Neverender
And all I was about to be
'Cause I remember
The hardest are the times I don't forget
Neverender
And all I was about to
I'll be goin'
Over what I could have done
Had I known
At the time
Because I remember
The hardest are the times I don't forget
Neverender
And all I was about to be
'Cause I remember
Neverender
And all I was about to promise
The time is upon us, I should've been honest
The pain in my heart, I remember the sharpest
It broke like a promise, I've fallen the hardest
And now I'll go on
The time is upon us, I should've been honest
The pain in my heart, I remember the sharpest
It broke like a promise, I've fallen the hardest
Regret is the feeling that lingers the longest
The time is upon us, I should've been honest
The pain in my heart, I remember the sharpest
It broke like a promise, I've fallen the hardest
Regret is the feeling that lingers the longest
The time is upon us, I should've been honest
The pain in my heart, I remember the sharpest
It broke like a promise, I've fallen the hardest
Regret is the feeling that lingers the longest
The time is upon us, I should've been honest
The pain in my heart, I remember the sharpest
It broke like a promise, I've fallen the hardest
And now I'll go on
Because I remember
The hardest are the times I don't forget
Neverender
And all I was about to be
'Cause I remember
Neverender
